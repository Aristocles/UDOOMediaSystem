These are all BASH/SH scripts (with the exception of crontab, which is an example of the contents of my crontab. YMMV).
Be sure to place the scripts in the location you specified in the cron jobs and make them executable (chmod +x scriptfile.sh).

The cron jobs also look for the location of the PID file for the processes it looks for. Be sure you set these correctly.
